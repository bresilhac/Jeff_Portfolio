### WIFIRE is an integrated system for wildfire analysis, with specific regard to changing urban dynamics and climate. The system integrates networked observations such as heterogeneous satellite data and real-time remote sensor data, with computational techniques in signal processing, visualization, modeling, and data assimilation to provide a scalable method to monitor such phenomena as weather patterns that can help predict a wildfire's rate of spread. You can read more about WIFIRE at: https://wifire.ucsd.edu/


## Project 2
### In this project I utilize various machine learning algorithms to determine the future prices of the stocks for five large cap companies including AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOG and FB.
